The Story

	- The first part of the story will take place around 3 weeks after the initial outbreak.
	- Subsequent parts may take place substantially further down the time line.

	- You are introduced to Henry
	- Henry's internal monologue helps introduce you to the bleak world he now lives in.
		- The world is experiencing pandemic crop failure
		- Food is becoming scarce as riots have gotten out of control
		- Infrastructure is breaking down. There's no zombies but people are going crazy and starting to fight for food
		- Henry has been on his own for the past 3 weeks.
		- With food running out he's finally contemplating venturing out to see what the world is like out there. He currently has no first hand experience aside from seeing the initial rioting on the news before the power went out.
		- Near the beginning he did head to a nearby supermarket to see if he could gather some supplies and he came back with: - a bag full of tinned food, some water and a few survival related supplies
		- There are now gangs of people that roam the streets, violence is everywhere and people are getting violent towards each other as desperation for food has set in.
		- You need to make a more long term plan. The woods might be a good option as there are plenty of fruits and berries and animals you could hunt.
		- The cabin is quite far though and making the journey unprepared could be dangerous so you need to be as prepared as you can before you go.

	- He eventually prepares a bit and leaves 'Henry's Apartment' to see if he can find some more food and supplies.
		- The streets are completely different now, the riots have quieted down but there are remnants everywhere.
		- People have died already and there are bodies in the streets.
	- You make your way towards the supermarket to see if there's anything useful left there.
		- Fortunately there is no one here at the moment, you're looking for :
			- A Torch
			- Batteries
			- Food
			- Medical Supplies (You won't find)
			- Maybe fishing line?
			- Salt
			- A weapon
			- Protective wear
		- Once you've finished finding what you can at the supermarket you head back out the way you came.

	- There are some wild dogs attacking a smaller dog outside and you instinctively try to chase them off
		- They attack and this is your first battle encounter
		- Once you beat the dogs you are left to rescue Beans

	- You bring him back to your apartment and try and clean up some of the blood but then you remember that your neighbor is training to be a surgeon and might be able to help.
		- You knock on Emily's door.
		- She's distrusting at first but you convince her that's its you and that you need her help
		- She eventually agrees and as soon as she sees the dog she begins helping immediately.
		- You both work on saving the dog and eventually he is stable and you can relax.
		- You ask her if she'd like to share some of the food you found and she agrees
		- Normal conversation ensues and she eventually agrees to join you towards the cabin. She wants to find a way to get in touch with her family from the next city over eventually.
		- They both sleep in the living room with the dog until morning.

		- END OF DAY 1


Chapter 1

	- What the hell was I thinking?
	- Beans? Why did I only grab beans? I hate beans.
	- I went out one time to the mega-mart to pick up supplies when this shit started and it was so insane down there. I just ran to the food isle and picked up whatever I could get my hands on. People were already panicking and there were fights breaking out all over the store. I don't even think I'd looked at what I managed to grab until I got back here.
	- I am starving though.
		A - Eat the beans
		B - Put the can away
		C - Throw the can out the window

	A - You begrudgingly eat the beans. You're feeling a bit more full.
	B - You put the can back in your rucksack.
	C - You throw the can out the window and it hits a parked car..d
